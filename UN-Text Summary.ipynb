    "  #### Second, I calculate the word score by counting the word relatively frequency. I use the word frequency divided by the Max frequently word in the paragraph. Thus, all the word frequency are bwteen 0 and 1. \n",
    "  #### Then, I do back to the sentence level, to calculate the sentence score by adding up the word frequency score for all the words in a srntence. Finally, pick out the highest score word to be the summarize sentence for the text. "
